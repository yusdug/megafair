    <h2>To understand analog electronics, the following must be understood:</h2>
    <p><strong>Voltage (V)</strong> is the potential difference between two points, indicating the energy needed to move a charge.</p>
    <p><strong>Current (A)</strong> represents the flow of charges through a conductor.</p>
    <p>Engineers design circuits to manipulate voltages and currents for specific applications without directly interacting with individual electrons...now -</p>
    <h2>What are analog signals?</h2>
    <p><strong>Analog signals are continuous signals that vary smoothly over time and can take any value within a range.</strong></p>
    <p>
        Unlike digital signals, which take discrete values, analog signals can vary smoothly across an infinite range of values. 
        <br>Key properties:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Amplitude: The height of the signal, representing the strength or intensity (like the volume in an audio signal).</li>
      <li>Frequency: The rate at which the signal oscillates per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). Higher frequencies mean faster oscillations.</li>
      <li>Phase: The relative position of the signal's wave cycle, especially important when dealing with overlapping signals.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>When analog signals are transmitted or processed, they can pick up unwanted disturbances called noise</h3>
    <p>
        Types of Noise:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Thermal Noise: Generated by the random motion of electrons in resistors or semiconductors. This is unavoidable and increases with temperature.</li>
        <li>Interference: Comes from other electronic devices or electromagnetic sources like radio waves.</li>
        <li>Phase: The relative position of the signal's wave cycle, especially important when dealing with overlapping signals.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Noise reduces clarity and quality. In electronics, reducing or filtering noise is key for better signal transmission and processing.</p>

    <h2>Circuit Theory</h2>
    <p>
      Passive components: They store or dissipate energy without amplifying the signal.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Resistors</strong> impede(hinder) current.</li>
      <li><strong>Capacitors</strong> store energy in an electric field.</li>
      <li><strong>Inductors</strong> store energy in a magnetic field.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Active components: They can control current flow and amplify signals, essential for building amplifiers and digital circuits.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Diodes</strong> allows current to flow easily in one direction, but severely restricts current from flowing in the opposite direction.</li>
      <li><strong>Transistors</strong> regulates or controls current or voltage flow in addition to amplifying and generating these electrical signals and acting as a switch or gate for them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Filtering</h2>
    <p>
      An electronic circuit called a filter circuit is made to either pass or block specific frequencies from an electrical signal. It is used through value of the cutoff frequency - the point in a frequency response at which the signal begins to be attenuated rather than fully passing through. 
      Notable examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low-pass filters</strong> attenuates signals higher than the cutoff frequency while permitting signals lower than the cutoff frequency to pass through.</li>
      <li><strong>High-pass filters</strong> attenuates signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency while permitting signals with frequencies greater than the cutoff frequency to pass through.</li>
      <li><strong>Band-pass filters</strong> attenuates signals outside of the passband while permitting signals inside the passband to pass through.</li>
    </ul>
